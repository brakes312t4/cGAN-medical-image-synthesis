# cGAN-medical-image-synthesis
Final project for Neural Networks Master's Course 2020 at Sapienza

This work explores some **simplified** conditional GANs for medical image synthesis inspired to [Medical Image Synthesis with Deep
Convolutional Adversarial Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310638) (2018). Visitors are encouraged to check the authors' current work at [https://github.com/ginobilinie/medSynthesisV1](https://github.com/ginobilinie/medSynthesisV1).
